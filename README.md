# VISTA | Vibrating Visualisation Tracker
___
VISTA (Vibrating Visualisation Tracker) is an assistive device for visually impaired people that uses AI Computer Vision technology by tracking and detecting objects around through real-time images captured by a camera. Then the tracked and detected object information will be processed to be generated as feedback in the form of vibrations. From the feedback in the form of vibrations blind people will easily know the surrounding conditions.
